# Metric Affine
Two Mathematica notebooks to study metric-affine theories of gravity. This is a companion repository to the paper [2306.????]()

## Package to install
The package [xAct](http://xact.es/) is necessary to run the codes.

## How to use files
One can simply clone the repository and then open the notebooks. (Alternatively, it is possible to click on "View Raw" file, select all text (Ctrl A), copy it (Ctrl C), paste it (Ctrl V) into an empty Mathematica page and select "Yes" to interpreting the text.)

## Content
* [Irreducible Decompositions](https://github.com/crigouzzo/metric-affine/blob/main/Decomposition_into_irrep.nb) - This notebook allows you to compute any cumbersome product of torsion, contorsion, non-metricity and disformation. We apply it to compute the general scalar curvature in the presence of torsion and non-metricity. We also check equations from our previous paper [2204.03003](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03003.pdf).
* [Deriving the Effective Action](https://github.com/crigouzzo/metric-affine/blob/main/Effective_Action.nb) - This notebook gives the solution of the Equation of Motions for torsion and non-metricity, as well as the effective action. From there, we can find the effective interaction terms induced by the presence of torsion and non-metricity.
