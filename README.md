# Metric Affine
A collection of Mathematica notebooks to study metric affine theories of gravity.

## Package to install
The package [xAct](http://xact.es/) is necessary to run the codes. It is a great tool to do abstract index computations, linearized calculations etc. In our case, we can use to perform the decomposition of torsion and non-metricity into irreducible components, and also find the solutions of equations of motions for them.

## How to use files
To open any of these notebooks, click on "View Raw" file, select all text (Ctrl A), copy it (Ctrl C), paste it (Ctrl V) into an empty Mathematica page and select "Yes" to interpreting the text.
