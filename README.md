# Metric Affine
A collection of Mathematica notebooks to study metric affine theories of gravity. This is a companion reposit to the paper [23??.????]()

## Package to install
The package [xAct](http://xact.es/) is necessary to run the codes. It is a great tool to do abstract index computations, linearized calculations etc. In our case, we can use to perform the decomposition of torsion and non-metricity into irreducible components, and also find the solutions of equations of motions for them.

## Content
* [Irreducible Decompositions](https://github.com/crigouzzo/metric-affine/blob/main/Decomposition_into_irrep_github.nb) - This notebook allows you to compute any cumbersome product of torsion, contorsion, non-metricity and disformation. We apply it to compute the general scalar curvature in the presence of torsion and non-metricity. We also check equations from our previous paper [2204.03003](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03003.pdf).
* [Solving Equations of motion](https://github.com/crigouzzo/metric-affine/blob/main/Solution_EOM_github.nb) - This notebook gives the solution of the Equation of Motions for torsion and non-metricity.
